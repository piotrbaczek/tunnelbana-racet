# tunnelbana-racet

This repository tries to solve a problem called "Tunnelbana Race".
It's a modified version of TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem),
started by Marcus Ahlin, on his channel
Stockholmshjärta (https://www.youtube.com/c/Stockholmshj%C3%A4rta) back in 2019.

So far there has been 2 editions: one in 2019 and the second one in 2021.
The 2020 was obviously cancelled due to chinese bat flu known as c19.

Each year Marcus, alongside his friends: Lars and Anders try to get through
all 100 stations of Stockholms Tunnelbana in shortest period of time.

Rules are as follows:

1. You start at the starting station
2. You can only walk/run or use public transport (tunnelbana, pendeltåg, bus)
3. You can't use taxi/scooters/mopeds
4. You have to go through all 100 stations of Stockholm tunnelbana
4. You must finish at the finish station
5. Fastest time wins
